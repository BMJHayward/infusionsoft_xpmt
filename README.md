=========================
Infusionsoft Experiment
=========================


[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/BMJHayward/infusionsoft_xpmt.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/BMJHayward/infusionsoft_xpmt)

API wrapper for Infusionsoft CRM. Infusionsoft a.k.a. 'IS' from here on. Intended usespecific reporting not found in

For target reports see classes inheriting from LocalDB, Query and Extract in dataserv.py.

DESCRIPTION
=============

Extract, transform, load data from IS, send to excel, csv, pandas, matplotlib, numpy etc.
This project will keep to the stdlib where ever possible to minimise dependencies, simplify deployment in several environme


dataserv.py is the main file of interest for the moment. this may be broken up in futuremore classes are ad

TODO:
========

+ include recordcount() to return all data when using 'all' argument
+ LeadtimeToSale() to output useful table of date(1stpurchase-1stcontact)
+ composition basic query objects for use in reporting class
+ possible Report() class for inidividual reports to inherit from
+ possible Transform() class for things common to each report
+ complete methods to compare datetime objects
+ use pandas or matplotlib for dataviz
+ statistics?
+ create file of functions to call _basequery() with different args
+ tests for class: LeadtimetoSale()
