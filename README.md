Infusionsoft Experiment
=========================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/BMJHayward/infusionsoft_xsvg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/BMJHayward/infusionsoft_xpmt)

DESCRIPTION
=============

API wrapper for Inonsoft CRM. Infusoft a.k.a. 'IS' frome Intended usespecifeporting not foun
Extract, transformad data from IS, send to excel, csv, pandmatplotlib, numpy 
dataserv and pandaserv are main files of interest for the mom
For target reports see classes inheriting from LocalDB, Query and Extrin dataserv.py.

TODO:
========

+ use pandas or matplotlib for IO/dataviz

HOW TO USE
============

1. Run and export 4 reports in your Infusionsoft account:
   1a. When you export these reports, ensure all the boxes are ticked under 'Choose fields to export'
   1b. Also, leave the date created fields blank to get the 'all time' results for your account
   1c. Save as CSV:
     + contacts (CRM -> Contacts -> Search -> Actions:Export -> Save as csv)
     + sales/orders (E-Commerce -> Orders -> Search -> Actions:Export -> Save as csv)
     + leadsource ROI (Marketing -> Reports -> Leadsource ROI -> Search ->Actions:Export-> Save as csv)
     + products (E-Commerce -> Products -> Actions:Export -> Save as csv)

2. Place the downloaded csv files in the same directory as dataserv.py

3. Do: '>>> python3 dataserv.py'. The terminal will ask a few questions:
    3a. Enter your preferred database name. A new database will be created. This allows you to have a few databases with different time frames if needed.
    3b. When asked the name of the contacts, sales, products and leadsource ROI files, enter the names of your downloaded CSV files from Infusionsoft
    3c. dataserv will do its thing, and will print an 'All done' when your report is ready.
    3.d You'll have a spreadsheet file named allstats.xls as the main output, with separate CSV for the 4 main reports.

4. The final 2 things are in Microsoft excel itself. When you open allstats.xls, go to the CSL tab to edit it. Select the 2nd column with (Percent profit, Dollar profit, expenses, revenue) as the header. Choose the excel function 'text to columns' from the Data tab in the ribbon. Choose the comma delimiter and then excel should split the data into 4 nice columns.

5. Use search and replace on '[', ']' to get rid of these, allowing you to make your charts and things.

6. For more data manipulation, simply create instances of each report class and send to Pandas, Numpy etc. E.g:

```
from dataserv import CostSaleLeadsource
import pandas as pd
newdata = CostSaleLeadsource().stats_CSL()
newdata_df = pd.DataFrame(newdata)

print('Do all your data things as you please')
```

     |  
     |  Static methods defined here:
     |  
     |  as3rdparty(self, queryfunc, filename)
     |      ' to send to pandas, matplotlib, etc etc
     |  
     |  ascsv(targlist, outfile)
     |      Pass in result of query as list of dicts from query. Alternately, use
     |      elif to pass result objects in different forms to the one function,
     |      or to several similar functions contained in Output class.
     |  
     |  ascsvdict(item, outfile)
     |      Item arg is list of dicts. Like ascsv but with DictWriter class.
     |  
     |  asfile(target=None, query=None, filename='dataserv.csv')
     |      primarily to send to spreadsheet. Target and query do same thing, was useful
     |      to make more sense interacting with Infusionsoft API.
     |  
     |  ashtml(self, queryfunc, filename)
     |      Put in data, intended to save as valid static webpage.
     |  
     |  asimage(self, queryfunc, filename)
     |      If you just want the visual form of your data.
     |  
     |  datetime_to_excel(dateobj)
     |  
     |  stats_getall(dbname)
     |      Get return data from all report classes,
     |      return dict of reportname:data pairs.
     |  
     |  stats_outputall(dbname)
     |  
     |  strap_csvfiles()
     |  
     |  to_picklejar(data_to_save, name)
     |      Give whatever object you have to pickle, save it for your next session with given name.

FUNCTIONS
    importer()
        csvarray should be string including .csv extension in local folder
    
    main()
    
    make_tablename()
        takes user input at command line for csv files exported from IS
    
    remove_duplicates(headerrow)
        Infusionsoft csv files often have duplicate strings as header row.
        When importing to sql, this raises sqlite3.OperationalError. Pass in the
        first row of your csv file to fix this. importer() calls this for you as well.

FUNCTIONS
==========

    clean_sheets(currency='AUD')
        Uses make_sheets(), and then processes to convert money from string to float,
        and datetime strings into datetime objects.
        Returns a dict of:
        {filename: pandas.DataFrame(filename)}
    
    dframe_currencystrip(dframe, col, currency='AUD')
        Iterate through a pandas dataframe stripping off currency codes and
        recast to float type. Pass in col and code as strings.
    
    dframe_dateconv(dframe, col)
        Go through date columns and convert to date format.
        dframe is a pandas dataframe object, col is target column of type string.
    
    get_raw_data(raw_data)
        Pass an array of file names, returns absolute paths of those
    
    make_onesheet(filepath)
        Pass an array of file paths,
        returns a pandas dataframe of that file
    
    make_sheets()
        Goes through files in RAW_DATA_DIR and returns
        a dict of:
        {filename: pandas.DataFrame(filename)}

DATA
    RAW_DATA_DIR = 'rawdata'
    currency = 'AUD'
    encodings = {'iso': 'ISO-8859-1', 'utf': 'utf-8', 'win': 'cp1252'}
    raw_data = ['df2.csv', 'datesdf.csv', 'moneydf.csv', 'df.csv']
